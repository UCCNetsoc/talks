					Writing a Discord Bot is a great opportunity to learn to code, or learn to use your coding abilities

				<h2>
					Why Javascript?
				</h2>
				<h5>
					Javascript has been the most commonly-used programming language for the 9th year in a row, so
					resources to get help and learn will be out there, and if you run into a problem, someoene else
					has (probably) already fixed it.

						About the Discord API

						Almost everyone who's used Discord has interacted with a bot at some point.
						They can provide instrumental uses in certain communities... Such as...

					<h3>Recently, Discord have decided they want to change the way bots work</h3>
					<h4>Previously, a bot would listen to every message in every guild it is invited to, whereas now,
						special "interactions" are formed between a user and a bot</h4>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The most common of which is the "slash command"</h3>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>The good about Slash Commands</h2>
				<p>They provide an interface to allow one to see how to run the command, as they are writing the command
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>The bad about Slash Commands</h2>
				<p>They make it more difficult to do more traditional discord bot functions, like simple messsage
					scanning, censoring etc...</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Intro to Slashing</h2>
					<p>Slash commands need to be registered, to provide a user interface to use a command that can store
						parameters</p>

					<h3>What can you do with a Discord bot?</h3>

					<h2>Make a game</h2>
					<h4>Myuu</h4>
					<img src="./assets/myuu.png" alt="">
					<p>This bot implements a Pokemon game system wherein you "catch" pokemon, and can trade and compete
						in PVP and many other features</p>

					<h2>But not all bots are simply just bots alone.</h2>

					<h3>Both of the (current) Netsoc discord bots have an API as well as a discord bot interface</h3>
